If you have tried balancing objects on their center of gravity, you may have observed that objects are easy to move around when in this state, requiring little force. It is this principle that is at the core of the gravity center solar tracker's functioning.
A solar array forming a single panel is balanced on its center of gravity on a support beam. When the panel is balanced in this way, it can be easily moved with little force. Four motors are present ( in the case of dual axis. Two if single axis ) each with a winch, wound with a cable that is also attached to the panel. Each at four seperate points. These motors pull on the panel individually , thus altering the position of the panel. By using four motors, we can achieve motion in two axis. This system can be used to track the sun. Either by using a photoresistor setup for active tracking or preferably, by scheduled tracking which should be more efficient. The system can run for a certain duration at suitable intervals instead of constantly tracking to save power. This setup may be more susceptible to wind. However this can be solved by installing brakes on the cables; which release when the motor is active and tighten when the motor is off, so wind cannot move the panel. The motor, the winch, the brake and other components may all be installed into a single unit; which will be refered to as the 'motor box'. The motor box will be the the primary electro-mechanical unit. It can be easily replaced, maintained, sealed from the environment, installed and moved around. The motor and its mechanical components can be relatively very small. This is possible because as the panel rests on its center of gravity, its inertia is low. So a small motor with limited torque is capable of moving the panel { refer the prototype images and notes for further insight }. When compared to traditional systems; the gravity center solar tracker is therefore low cost, requires less power, easily maintainable, easily installable ( and on almost any terrain ), more weather resistant and suitable for a wide range of tracking applications.
