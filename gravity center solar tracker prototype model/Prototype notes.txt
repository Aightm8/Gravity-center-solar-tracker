This prototype model is simple in construction, made out of household materials. For demonstrative purposes the model tracks any light 
source using a photoresistor setup. This is a single axis tracker but a dual axis one is very much possible. The electrical system
uses a microcontroller board connected to a relay module to control two small DC motors. A winch is attached to each motor.
Thread ( acts as the cable ) is wound around the winch and attached to the 'panel'. When the motor is on it pulls the thread and thus
the panel. The opposite motor at that point will be off. The panel rests at a point close to its true center of gravity, this point
was chosen roughly. Nonetheless, the panel is balanced. 

It was possible for the small motor and the thin thread to move the relatively large panel, and at a quick rate; despite the motor's 
limited torque. As the panel rests on its center of weight, its inertia is much lower and therefore it can be moved more easily. 
A traditional tracking system to move the same panel with the same motor would not have been possible unless with a gear box but even then, 
it would have been much slower. Large arrays of panels can therefore have relatively small, low power motor winch systems capable of moving
them. Wind from the ceiling fan wasn't a major obstacle to the model's functioning either.

The model could not be tested under the sun as the winch of this model was very troublesome. As can be expected from one made out of
bottle caps, reinforced with blu-tack and running thin thread. Yet as can be seen in the videos, the model works well. A larger
system can too.
